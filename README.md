# LiteProxy

## This Project is Currently Under Development, So Please Stay Tuned for Further Update

## Project Preview: 

- [] LiteProxy is a Compact Proxy That is Capable of Generating Multiple Proxy Servers/Client, Supporting Various Protocols (we will get to that later, only SOCKS4, SOCKS5 and Http protocols will be implemented in the foreseeable future)

- [] This Tool can either be used as a Go dependency package within other go code, or to be used as a commandline tool with an entry point. LiteProxy will be very flexible and rubust for both way of usage, offering param customization (Authetication Method Priority Setting, TLS Encryption, Pre-Bufferred Requests, Net Connection Limits, etc) in code and can accept JSON configuration files.

- [] Will add Web Framwork so that users can use the tool on their browser
